title: StreetSupport goes live!
---

Today we are proud to launch [Street Support](http://beta.streetsupport.net)! This mobile-first web-app connects homeless charities, voluntary groups and the public, to make it easier for homeless people to get the help they need.

Working with [Objectives First](http://objectivesfirst.com/), [Phil Lennon](http://iampjl.co.uk/) and [Kim Foale](http://alliscalm.net/) Polyhat developed the API to aggregate data collated on the multitude of homeless support organisations across Manchester, as well as contributing to front-end development.

The site is currently in beta whilst the data collated is verified by the service providers. We'll be working on many new features for the site, including an administration area for the service providers, and ways for people to give help.

Technologies used:

* C#
* NancyFX
* MongoDB
* Javascript
* Metalsmith
