title: Polyhat is Born!
---

On this day, Polyhat Software was born! The company was formed to help clients focus on value in their software projects, and keep their codebase robust and flexible to change. We are dedicated to agile methodologies to ensure we, and the teams we work with, are continuously delivering value and improving processes; focussing on providing solutions, rather than the endless re-write.

We are particularly interested in providing modern software development practices to companies and organisations dedicated to social improvement, at a reduced rate.
